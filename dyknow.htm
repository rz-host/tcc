				<h1>Did You Know?</h1>
				<p class="noindent"><b>Did you know ... the Bible is the final authority?</b></p>
				<p class="noindent"><em>The Bible says:</em></p>
				<p>But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you (1 Peter 1:25).</p>
				<p>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed (Galatians 1:8).</p>
				<p>All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness (2 Timothy 3:16).</p>
				<p>And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book (Revelation 22:19).</p>
				<br />
				<p class="noindent"><b>Did you know ... all men have sinned?</b></p>
				<p class="noindent"><em>The Bible says:</em></p>
				<p>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23).</p>
				<p>Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned (Romans 5:12).</p>
				<br />
				<p class="noindent"><b>Did you know ... sin brings sadness and eternal death?</b></p>
				<p class="noindent"><em>The Bible says:</em></p>
				<p>For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord (Romans 6:23).</p>
				<p>Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions'? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine (Proverbs 23:29-30).</p>
				<p>The sorrow of the world worketh death (2 Corinthians 7:10).</p>
				<p>The soul that sinneth, it shall die (Ezekiel 18:4).</p>
				<p>He that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death (Proverbs 11: 19).</p>
				<br />
				<p class="noindent"><b>Did you know ... our good works cannot save us?</b></p>
				<p class="noindent"><em>The Bible says:</em></p>
				<p>But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousness are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away (Isaiah 64:6).</p>
				<p>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity (Matthew 7:22-23).</p>
				<p>Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified (Galatians 2:16).</p>
				<br />
				<p class="noindent"><b>Did you know ... we can be saved by the grace of God?</b></p>
				<p class="noindent"><em>The Bible says:</em></p>
				<p>For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast (Ephesians 2:8-9).</p>
				<p>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost (Titus 3:5).</p>
				<br />
				<p class="noindent"><b>Did you know ... this is your only salvation?</b></p>
				<p class="noindent"><em>The Bible says:</em></p>
				<p>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved (Acts 4:12).</p>
				<p>How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? (Hebrews 9:14).</p>
				<p>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9).</p>
				<p>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name (John 1: 12).</p>
				<p>That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt he saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation (Romans 10:9-10).</p>
				<p>And the times of this ignorance God winked at: but now commandeth all men every where to repent (Acts 17:30).</p>
				<br />
				<p class="noindent"><b>Did you know ... the Bible condemns:</b></p>
				<p class="noindent"><i>1. pride and hatred ?</i></p>
				<p>Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves (Philippians 2:3).</p>
				<p class="noindent"><i>2. lying?</i></p>
				<p>For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie (Revelation 22:15).</p>
				<p class="noindent"><i>3. divorce and remarriage?</i></p>
				<p>And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her. And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery (Mark 10:11- 12).</p>
				<p class="noindent"><i>4. illicit social relationships?</i></p>
				<p>But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; ... for this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God (Ephesians 5:3, 5).</p>
				<br />
				<p class="noindent"><b>Did you know ... the Bible teaches us to:</b></p>
				<p class="noindent"><i>1.fear God (reverence)?</i></p>
				<p>Be not highminded, but fear (Romans 11:20).</p>
				<p>And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell (Matthew 10:28).</p>
				<p>Fear God (1 Peter 2:17).</p>
				<p class="noindent"><i>2. humble ourselves?</i></p>
				<p>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord (James 4:10).</p>
				<p>But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve (Luke 22:26).</p>
				<p>Submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble (I Peter 5:5).</p>
				<p class="noindent"><i>3. live in holiness?</i></p>
				<p>Because it is written, Be ye holy: for I am holy (1 Peter 1:16).</p>
				<p>Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord (Hebrews 12:14).</p>
				<p>Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God (2 Corinthians 7:1).</p>
				<br />
				<p class="noindent"><b>Did you know ... true Christians obey God?</b></p>
				<p class="noindent"><em>The Bible says:</em></p>
				<p>Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone (James 2:17).</p>
				<p>If ye love me, keep my commandments (John 14:15).</p>
				<p>He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him (1 John 2:4-5).</p>
				<br />
				<p class="noindent"><b>Did you know ... we will be judged by God?</b></p>
				<p class="noindent"><em>The Bible says:</em></p>
				<p>God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel (Romans 2:16).</p>
				<p>And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment (Hebrews 9:27).</p>
				<br />
				<p class="noindent"><b>Did you know ... we will be judged by what we do in life?</b></p>
				<p class="noindent"><em>The Bible says:</em></p>
				<p>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad (2 Corinthians 5:10).</p>
				<p>And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be (Revelation 22:12).</p>
				<br />
				<p>These Scriptures show us the way to God. If we earnestly seek God, submit our lives to Him, and obey the Bible, we will find the way to heaven.</p>
				<p>Many churches tolerate sin today. Hundreds of pastors hold man's ideas above the Bible. But regardless of the corruption in our society and in many churches, God continues to require holiness of life.</p>
				<p>The choice is yours. Will you accept the truth?</p>
				<p>"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap" (Galatians 6:7).</p>
				<p>"He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day" (John 12:48).</p>
